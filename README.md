# Intro to Recommendation Systems in Python

### Skill level: intermediate

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy 
- scikit-learn

Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupiter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to locally install any of the above; however, you will need a gmail account. 

### Description

In this workshop, we will explore the different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. We will also build our own recommendation system using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

### What is a recommendation system?

A recommendation system is an algorithm that matches items to users. Its goal is to predict a user's preference toward an item.

**Examples:**

- recommending products based on past purchases or product searches (Amazon)
- suggesting TV shows or movies based on prediction of a user's interests (Netflix)
- creating well-curated playlists based on song history (Spotify)
- personalized ads based on "liked" posts or previous websites visited (Facebook)

The two most commonly used methods for recommendation systems are: 1) collaborative filtering, and 2) content-based filtering.

### How do we define a user's "preference" towards an item?

There are two types of feedback data:

1. Implicit feedback (e.g., number of times a user has watched a movie)
2. Explicit feedback (e.g., movie ratings)
